# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Jellyfin knows the resolution and HDR of a friend's movie or episode as soon as it is imported, not only
  after someone played it (and its codec, once the friend runs this version too). Apps show them, the 4K/HD
  filters work, and Jellyseerr (Seerr) sees friends' movies as available, so nobody requests them again.
- Radarr and Sonarr (optional, *Bloom → Radarr and Sonarr*): what a friend already has isn't downloaded a second
  time, unless your quality profile wants better than their copy (or never, or always: you choose). Friends'
  movies and shows can also be added, unmonitored, so Radarr and Sonarr show them as already there. Bloom undoes
  all of it once your friends no longer have them, and never touches what you monitored yourself.

## 0.2.3

- Choose how friends' badges look (*Bloom → This server → Badge on friends' posters*): tinted glass in the
  friend's colour (new default), clear glass, colour label, corner ribbon, Netflix-style bottom tab, the poster's
  own colour, a blurred Apple TV-style bottom, a discreet Bloom mark, or the classic pill. Each friend keeps the
  same colour. Badges now use the Inter typeface, shipped with Bloom. Changing the style redraws their posters.
- Intros: set a short video as your server's intro. Your friends get it at sync, and their Jellyfin plays it
  before each of your movies (apps with cinema mode, when starting from the beginning). Each server can turn
  its friends' intros off.
- Choose the name a friend is shown under on your server (*Name shown here*), for the badge, the tag and the
  version picker.
- A friend renaming their server no longer renames every file imported from them (#12).
- What you own is indexed once per sync run instead of once per friend (#13).

## 0.2.2

Fixes from a review of the code.

- Security: requests between servers are checked more strictly before anything is stored (sender id, absurd
  timestamps, invites without a token), and the memory used against replayed requests is capped.
- Security: Bloom no longer follows redirects, and only follows a friend to a new address once that address
  answers with the friend's identity. A friend's server can no longer send your server's requests elsewhere.
- Security: playback links now expire after 30 to 60 days (friends get fresh ones at each sync), and pairing
  again with a friend revokes the old ones.
- A friend's server can no longer exhaust your server's memory with a huge poster or answer.
- Renaming the library a friend's items are merged into no longer removes them: Bloom follows the new name.
  A library that was deleted no longer stops the friend's other libraries from syncing.
- Changing the folder for friends' media now moves their items instead of importing them twice.
- Tags on friends' items are always in the server's language, even when a sync is started from the settings
  page in another language.
- Emoji in titles and summaries are kept.
- The settings page no longer throws away unsaved changes to a friend while a sync runs.
- Unusual error answers from a friend's server no longer break removing that friend.
- The release workflow can no longer drop earlier versions from the plugin repository.

## 0.2.1

- Servers that sleep when idle are supported: a proxy such as nginx-hibernator or Sablier stops Jellyfin and
  starts it again on the next request. Tick *My server sleeps when nobody uses it* in *Bloom → This server*:
  friends no longer wake your server on their own, sync with it whenever it starts, and only wake it to play one
  of your movies.
- Playing a friend's movie while their server is starting now waits for it instead of failing, and so do
  downloads (used by Infuse to play).
- Syncs no longer fail when a friend's server is starting: Bloom tries again for up to 2 minutes when it answers
  502, 503 or 504. Jellyfin itself answers 503 while it starts.
- When Jellyfin starts, Bloom tells its friends and syncs with them.

## 0.2.0

- Bloom is now in English as well as French. The settings page follows the language you use Jellyfin in;
  the scheduled task, tags and sync errors follow the server's language.
- Errors sent by a friend's server are shown in your own language.
- Dates on the settings page follow Jellyfin's language too.

## 0.1.0

First release.

- Friends' servers are added by exchanging invites (ECDSA keys, fingerprint check, signed requests).
- Their movies and shows appear in your own libraries, or in a separate one, matched by library type,
  with posters, summaries, cast and subtitles. They play straight from the friend's server.
- The friend's name is drawn as a small badge on their posters and episode images.
- What you already have is not imported again. When you have it in another quality, theirs becomes a
  version you can pick ("Alice 4K"), and yours stays the default.
- Missing episodes are added to your own series.
- Friends are told when your library changes and update within minutes; a full sync runs every 6 hours.
- "Download" in Jellyfin apps returns the friend's video.
